#HTML5 APIs Workshop

Let's take a look at some interesting APIs that are added with the new [HTML5 specifications](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/).

## To be covered

* Fullscreen API

## Foundation

The first thing we need is to make sure we are running an HTML5 capabale web browser. You can check out how well your broswer preforms [here](http://html5test.com/) and then also check the specific APIs [here](http://caniuse.com/). Make sure your browswer can handle all the APIs that we will be covering in this workshop.

If you think you will run into problems get the latest version of [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

## Basic template

Listed below is a basic HTML5 compliant structure for a new web page. This is the structure we will base the workshop on. Get familiar with all the basic elements and what they mean.

If you are really clever, you will be able to code this from scratch!

    <!doctype html>
    
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
    
      <title>HTML5 API Workshop</title>
    
      <!--[if lt IE 9]>
